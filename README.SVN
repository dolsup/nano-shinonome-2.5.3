INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE AND INSTALL NANO CVS VERSIONS
=====================================================

GNU nano is available from SVN, but building this needs a bit more care
than the official stable and unstable tarballs.


Prerequisites
-------------

To successfully compile GNU nano from CVS, you'll need the following
packages:

- autoconf (version >= 2.54)
- automake (version >= 1.7)
- gettext  (version >= 0.11.5)
- groff    (version >= 1.12)
- texinfo  (version >= 4.0)
- subversion (aka svn)
- glib 2.x (if your system doesn't have vsnprintf(), which the configure
  script will check for)
- make, gcc and the normal development libraries (curses or slang, etc.)

These should be available on your GNU mirror.  Note that you'll need a
version of curses or slang with wide character support if you want nano
to use UTF-8.


Download the source
-------------------

To obtain the current nano development code (called 'trunk'), use the
following command.  It will create a copy of the files in a subdirectory
of your current working directory called 'nano':

    $ svn co svn://svn.savannah.gnu.org/nano/trunk/nano

If you want to download the stable SVN branch instead, use:

    $ svn co svn://svn.savannah.gnu.org/nano/branches/nano_2_2_branch/nano


Generate the configure script
-----------------------------

Once you have the sources in the "nano" directory,

    $ cd nano
    $ ./autogen.sh

This will set up a configure script and a Makefile.in file.


Configure your build
--------------------

To configure your build, run the configure script from the nano source
directory:

    $ ./configure [--add-options-here]


Build and install
-----------------

From the nano source directory, build the code with:

    $ make

Then, once it's done compiling, run

    $ make install

which should copy various files (i.e. the nano executable, the info and
man pages, and syntax highlighting pattern files) to their appropriate
directories.

If you're installing into the default install directory (/usr/local),
you'll need to run that "make install" command with root privileges.


Problems?
---------

Please submit any bugs in the SVN branch using the Savannah project's
bug tracker (https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano).
